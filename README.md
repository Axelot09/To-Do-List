# To-Do-List

The to-do list application is a straightforward task management tool created using Python’s tkinter library, offering a user-friendly graphical interface. Users can easily add tasks by typing them into an entry field and clicking the “Add Task” button. The tasks are displayed in a list box, where users can select and delete tasks or mark them as completed with corresponding buttons. This application helps organize and prioritize daily tasks efficiently, enhancing productivity by keeping track of what needs to be done and what has already been accomplished.
